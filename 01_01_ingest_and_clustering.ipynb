    "> Note: this sections' notebooks and modules use sequence diagrams and annotated code to illustrate the development of one of the primary processes that make up _SC2 Training Grounds'_ computer model. I chose to develop this part of the document in the most specific level of detail because the base concept of _SC2 Training Grounds_ is to use player experience modelling to generate recommendations. Player experience modelling requires defining a way to abstract and transform the players' experience into quantifiable data, which I do in this module (see dissertation chapter 5.2).\n",

    "Based on this proposed flow of orders, I first need to implement the ingest process for StarCraft II replay files. This ingestion process is essential to structure the input for the clustering process. Furthermore, it also determines the input of the application's classification modelling process, as shown in SC2 Training Grounds activity diagram (see Section 1's introduction).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the sequence diagram, I show that the ingestion process is, on a top-level, composed of two main functions,  `inventory_replays` and `get_replay_indicators`. `inventory_replays` registers the replays so that a user can use their basic meta-data to reference specific replays and identify their players. Meanwhile, `get_replay_indicators` compiles all performance indicators of each player in each replay. Thus, the system can loop through various replays and extract and store the performance indicators for each player in each game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having understood how the functions are supposed to interact, I implement them in the following modules. The most important outcome of this implementation is the structure of the players' performance indicators and how this data is indexed. In other words, this definition determines the information vectors that will become the inputs for the clustering and classification modelling process afterwards. \n",

Since different pieces relate to different categories of information, I group the functions in separate modules according to those categories. \n",
