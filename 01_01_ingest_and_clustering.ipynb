    "> Note: this sections' notebooks and modules use sequence diagrams and annotated code to illustrate the development of one of the primary processes that make up _SC2 Training Grounds'_ computer model. I chose to develop this part of the document in the most specific level of detail because the base concept of SC2 Training Grounds is to use player experience modelling to generate recommendations. Player experience modelling requires defining a way to abstract and transform the players' experience into quantifiable data, which I do in this module (see dissertation chapter 5.2).\n",
