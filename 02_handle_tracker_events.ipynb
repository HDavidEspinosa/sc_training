    "\n",
    "  In the following modules, I separate the analysis of many performance indicators derived from several types of Tracker Events into four game intervals, i.e. the whole, early, mid and late games. These intervals are meant to match the economy and initial strategy building portion of the game (i.e. the early game), the initial strategy execution and response state (i.e. the mid-game), and the counter strategic stage of the game (i.e. the late-game).  The early match takes typically between 4 and 5 minutes, or 240 and 300 seconds. Afterwards, the mid-game takes about the same time. Suppose the game has not ended by minutes 8 to 10. In that case, players typically re-organise their strategy using updated, more advanced and expensive, units, i.e. late game.\n",
    "  Thus, in this case, I establish a base value in seconds that I use in later modules as the finish time for the early game. I also use it to calculate the end mark of the mid-game as double this base value. The late-game always covers the portion from the mid-game's end to the match's end.\n",
