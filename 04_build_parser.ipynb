    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, I review how to extract information on a player's build strategy. In accordance with this review I then  define the `build_parser` module. This module contains functions that developers can use to parse the players' build orders, and to inventory their army, base and technology upgrades.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Builds-orders\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial part of how players execute a strategy is how they construct their bases and their armies. Currently, in the game, players can review the order in which the game participants build their first 40 elements once a match is over. These build-orders include buildings (built, upgraded, expanded), units (trained, mutated, warped, merged), and any tech researched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this package is meant to build player profiles based on the players' performance indicators, I need to find a way to capture the overall composition of the players' bases and armies. Moreover, afterwards, I must be able to generalise this composition data to build the players profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, my first instinct was to store the build orders as a time series. I thought of recording a sequence of snapshots, evenly spaced over time, that marked the time and order in which each element entered the game. However, storing the build-orders as a time series is too detailed and is not suited to practical generalisation. Hence, I am opting to extract units, buildings and research compositions at four different game intervals, i.e. whole, early, mid, and late games. These intervals match the measures that I take for macroeconomic indicators in <<Chapter 3 - Parsing Macroeconomic Indicators>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores the factors I need to consider to define a set of functions that users can call to extract the player's elements compositions at the different game intervals and other related indicators."

    "### Listing a player's elements\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the first step to parse any indicators related to the build order is to obtain a list of the player's elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, I use the `Player` object's `units` attribute to extract a list of all these elements owned by the player during the match. I also use a list of all the units I want to include in my analysis (i.e. `UNIT_NAMES`) to filter unwanted units. For example, I exclude Zerg larvae from my analysis because they are generated automatically by the game with little control from the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In this example, I exclude some units that change their play-state during the game (e.g. burrowed troops). I exclude these units for the time being to focus on the game's basic unit types. Later, I expand on some considerations related to this stage changes that I need to account for in the module's `composition_df` helper function to generate an accurate unit count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow me to describe the code step by step to clarify the ideas behind this module. First, I will define multiple constant values that I will use through the module's development to filter various data characteristics. These constants store information from multiple data files saved in this project's data folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constants include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNIT_NAMES`: list of names for all the player-controllable units (buildings or troops) in the game. This list only contains one name per unit and excludes the various states a unit can have. \n",
    "- `RACE_ARMIES`: list of controllable troops separated by race; excludes workers and structures.\n",
    "- `RACE_BUILDINGS`: list of controllable structures separated by race.\n",
    "- `RACE_UPGRADES`: list of tech updates that players can research during a match. The list excludes any default upgrades that players do not directly trigger. "

    "This same rule applies to buildings. However, in this case, there are two caveats when counting Terran buildings. First, _TechLab_ and _Reactor_ instances do not follow the same _Unit/State_ naming convention as the other multi-state units. Instead, they follow the inverse pattern, _State/Unit_. Second, both _TechLab_ and _Reactor_ generate a double count. Firstly, they appear as themselves, and, secondly, they re-register the production buildings they expand (i.e. barracks, starports, and factories). In this case, they re-register these production buildings with the same hash-id that identifies them. Thus, when counting Terran buildings, I must re-filter the DataFrame to account for these anomalies. The following code illustrates this issue."

    "After calculating a player's army composition or unit started counts, I need to format the output of the functions so that I can process them with the results of other matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, I considered two options. On the one hand, I could store counts for all units of all races for each player in every match. Following this approach, I would have a single set of replays for each player that would, by averaging all unit counts, express the general building preferences of each player. On the other hand, I could segregate the results by game race. This second option implies that I would have to keep three separate sets of replays per player. I would also have to process three profiles per player that express their preferences when playing each game race.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although initially, I was inclined to opt for the first option, I decided on the second because it seems closer to the actual game experience. For example, in StarCraft II, players are classified separately in leagues when playing with different game races. Similarly, many of the game's achievements are repeated for each race. Thus, it felt more akin to the game experience to provide threes profiles.\n",
    "This second approach also means that each match's record will contain fewer blanc data points when processing the profiles, which safes storage and processing memory.\n",
