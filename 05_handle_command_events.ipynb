For the most part, these indicators revolve around economic and building indicators, which point to the game's strategic (i.e. macro) dimension. Meanwhile, beyond what a player's build orders and army composition may tangentially suggest, these indicators don't seem to reveal much about the game's tactical (i.e. micro) dimension.\r\n",

Thus, I will take this indicator into account when building the player's profiles. Thankfully, sc2reader includes the `APMTracker` pug-in that facilitates the collection of this information [(Kim, 2015, p. 16-17)](https://sc2reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#apmtracker).\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "First, I define the function `calc_spe_abil_ratios`. In this function, I use the special abilities list to calculate the ratio between them and the total commands executed by the player. With this ratio, I can quantify the use of these abilities. The measurement helps me separate players that use their race's unique capabilities from those who do not.\r\n",

    "> Note: Following the logic set in previous modules, I define these functions to calculate all indicators for the early, mid, late and whole game. Although I do this to remain consistent, I also think this level of detail makes sense given how players have access to different units and abilities at various game stages.\r\n"
