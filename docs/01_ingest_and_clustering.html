<p>Section 1 outlines the <strong>ingest</strong> and <strong>clustering</strong> processes as parts of <em>SC2 Training Grounds'</em> computer model.
{% include note.html content='this sections&#8217; notebooks and modules use sequence diagrams and annotated code to illustrate the development of one of the primary processes that make up <em>SC2 Training Grounds&#8217;</em> computer model. I chose to develop this part of the document in the most specific level of detail because the base concept of SC2 Training Grounds is to use player experience modelling to generate recommendations. Player experience modelling requires defining a way to abstract and transform the players&#8217; experience into quantifiable data, which I do in this module (see dissertation chapter 5.2).' %}
The following sequence diagram shows the proposed flow of orders and data between modules. In particular, it shows how the library's main module (i.e. sc_training) can orchestrate the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the replay files generated by StarCraft II.</li>
<li>Call upon the <em>ingest</em> sub-package to inventory the replays and store their relevant indicators into various collections within a document-based database using a local MongoDB client. </li>
<li>Use the <em>profiler</em> sub-package to build the player profiles from the replay data collections.</li>
<li>Process the player profiles by game race to build each race classification clusters using the <em>cluster</em> sub-package. </li>
</ol>
