    "## Executive Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "`sc_training` is a python library developed to document, organise and communicate the design of *SC2 Training Grounds'* computer model. I developed this library for the following purposes:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. To review the technical challenges associated with creating a solution such as *SC2 Training Grounds*.\r\n",
    "2. To assess the possibilities and limitations of the resources I could use to develop this solution. Therefore, allowing me to design a more realistic and grounded user experience for the application. \r\n",
    "3. To provide a proof-of-concept that tests the technical feasibility of the project.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this case, I used literate and iterative programming to develop the library while providing a narrative explanation and documentation of this process (Knuth, 1984; Ramsey, 1994; Literate Programming, 2014; Kery et al., 2018). This methodology allows rapid testing and exploration of ideas while integrating them into a functioning program (Howard, 2019). Hence, the library is simultaneously the program's documentation and the program itself."

    "## Accessing the Library's Files and Documentation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "> Note: a pdf version of this document is attached as Appendix C of my PhD project. This format is included for convenience. However, I remind the reader that, in this format, the library loses part of its original functions as an interactive artefact. Readers can download all the files described below from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HDavidEspinosa/sc_training).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To facilitate the use of literary programming, I developed this library using I used [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). The use of this tool means that this library is rendered in various ways to accommodate different interests. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- First, since nbdev uses _interactive notebooks_ (see [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) as a development environment, the library was developed and is originally contained in this format. These interactive documents intertwine textual elements that describe the ideas that support its components and the source code that defines its functions (see [Jupyter/IPython Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a guide on how to set up the Jupyter and IPython libraries to use these documents). \r\n",
    "- Second, the library is also exported as a traditional _python library_. Readers can find a functioning version of all the library's modules in the [repository's `sc_training` folder](https://github.com/HDavidEspinosa/sc_training/tree/master/sc_training), which they can use to replicate and verify any examples and experiments explored in this deliverable. \r\n",
    "- Third, these notebooks produce a _website_ that serves as the library's [Interactive Documentation](https://hdavidespinosa.github.io/sc_training/). This documentation omits many technical details focusing on the descriptions of the development process and the library's structure."

    "## Setup\r\n",
    "Before going into the document itself, it is important to clarify some aspects regarding their composition. \r\n",

    "Because of the nature of the documents, each notebook is exported as a module of the `sc_training` library. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Meanwhile, since each notebook works as a separate module, I have to include some setup elements at the beginning of each document. Since this process is almost identical in most cases, I will cover it here so that I can hide it in the module's documentation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "> Note: Remember that any elements I hide in these documents can still be reviewed and verified in the library's development notebooks and the library's exported source code.\r\n",
